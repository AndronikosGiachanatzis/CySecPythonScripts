# CySecPythonScripts
This repository contains some simple python scripts that I am building to automate and facilitate common tasks related to Cyber Security operations.

The scripts inside the repository were built in order to facilitate some simple tasks that are often needed, such as MAC changer scripts, Network Scanner, ARP Spoofers ...

They intend to mimic/copy parts of the operation of popular tools (such as nmap, netdiscover) but in a simple way.

They were built while I was attending Cyber Security courses during my 3rd year in my university and especially pythoon implementations in Cyber Security
